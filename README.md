🖐 Hi! My name is Nicolás Oleinizak and i'm a fullstack web developer 💻🌐 with experience on tecnologies such as Javascript and PHP, I prefer backend development though ;) 
Working hard for getting better every day, but having fun. 

I work now in several web projects using frameworks or libraries like Laravel, React, Vue, Express. Also, i'm very interested in AI and machine learning.

Currently, I'm going deeper into Laravel, Vue and NestJS, and willing to have time enough to also see so many other things (Python and IA specially)
